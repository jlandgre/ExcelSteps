* We are going to write a VBA Class called PanelData that executes multistep procedures made up of several functions.
* We will use a custom VBA unit test suite to test the class.
* Before we start class-specific coding and testing, we need to initialize the VBA Projects for the code project and unit test workbooks.
* We will use a rows/columns (Excel) code plan to provide describe the "tables", "procedures" and "sub-functions" for the project.
* We will make extensive use of tbls, which is a class instance whose attributes are tblRowsCols or tblRowsColsLite class instances. These objects track  rows/columns tables within the project and have attributes like .wkbk and .wksht for the VBA workbook and worksheet objects and .rngRows and .rngHeader, which are a row range for populated data and a range of Row1 variable names at the top of the table.
* This code plan Tables description lists the two tblRowsCols instances and one tblRowsColsLite instance for an example project that has tables callse RawData, RepData and Params.
* Our project will use the errs instance of a custom ErrorHandling class to handle errors in the PanelData class. errs is declared as a global variable in the project, and the xxx function call at the beginning of each function instances errs if it has not been initialized by a calling function.

```
Table Name	Type of tbl instance
RawData	tblRowsCols
RepData	tblRowsCols
Params	tblRowsColsLite
```
* Based on our PanelData code plan, we need to create a VBA class called Tables like this one.
```
* This is the Tables VBA class based on the code plan
